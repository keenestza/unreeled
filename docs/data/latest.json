After repeated and unsuccessful attempts to help him, Alice is confronted with a painful choice: should she honor her promise, or listen to her reason?  This short film sheds light on the dilemma faced by victims of domestic violence, when giving up on saving the other becomes the only way to save oneself.",

      "synopsis": "**An Ordinary Morning, A Silent Change**\r\nOn a quiet winter morning in Delhi, a familiar routine breaks. The house feels different. The air feels heavier. What begins as an ordinary day slowly turns into a silent encounter with life, loss, and an unseen truth waiting to be noticed.\r\n**A Stranger Who Was Never Truly Known**\r\nSome people live beside us for years, yet remain strangers. Some endings arrive without warning. Through gentle observation and quiet moments, this story reflects on how easily we overlook the lives moving around us — until one absence suddenly becomes louder than any presence.\r\n**A Mother's Wisdom, A Son's Realisation**\r\nThrough tender conversations and a mother's simple yet powerful words, the story explores how modern life has changed our idea of living. We run faster, we achieve more, yet breathe less. The past struggled to survive. The present struggles to feel alive.\r\n**Still Breathing**\r\nStranger's Death is not a story meant to shock. It is meant to awaken. It speaks about forgotten pauses, unnoticed connections, and the fragile truth that we remember how to live only when something reminds us that we are still breathing.\r\nSoft, emotional, and deeply human, this short story invites you to slow down — just long enough to see what you may have been missing all along.\r\nBecause sometimes, life does not change in loud moments.\r\nIt changes in silence.",

      "synopsis": "Este livro analisa a construção da subjetividade feminina no romance Pequena coreografia do adeus, de Aline Bei, articulando literatura contemporânea e teoria feminista. A partir de autoras como Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Butler, Heleieth Saffioti e Clarissa Pinkola Estés, a obra investiga como gênero, violência, maternidade, abandono e silenciamento atravessam a formação da personagem Júlia Terra. A análise destaca a escrita poética e fragmentária de Bei como forma de inscrição do trauma e da memória no corpo do texto. Ao evidenciar a literatura como espaço de resistência e elaboração subjetiva, o estudo contribui para os debates sobre autoria feminina e representação das experiências das mulheres na contemporaneidade.",

But when the Church hands down a prophecy to his fellow knights predicting that the only way to defeat their nemesis, the mad sorcerer Merulo, is to kill Sir Cameron, he finds himself in a situation too sticky for even his considerable wiles. Short of ideas, Cameron throws himself on the mercy of the one person who now actually wants him to the mad sorcerer.\r\n\r\nMerulo isn't thrilled to be babysitting a spoilt, attention-seeking knight, but fate has tied them together. And transmogrifying Cameron into a vulture is at least a great source of entertainment. Cameron, meanwhile, is on a voyage of self-discovery. It turns out he's really, really into surly sorcerers who lock him up and tell him what to do. Who knew?\r\n\r\nAs a legion of knights surround their stronghold, led by an angry concussed elf—which definitely isn't in any way Cameron's fault—the sorcerer's poisonous ambitions draw ever closer to fruition. Cameron is quite invested in not dying, but he finds he's also invested in Merulo. And sometimes, supporting the sorcerer you care about means taking an interest in their hobbies. Even if their hobby is trying to kill God.\r\n\r\nEven if it might get you killed, too.",

Together they’ve experienced the highest highs of love and family, and lows so low that they felt like the end of the world.\r\n\r\nNow, the world is ending for real. A wandering blackhole is coming for Earth and in a month everything and everyone they’ve ever known will be gone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, after 40 years together, Don and Rodney are out of time. They’re in a race against the clock to make it from Maine to Washington State to take care of some unfinished business before it’s all over.\r\n\r\nOn the road they meet those who refuse to believe death is coming and those who rush to meet it. But there are also people living their final days as best they know how–impromptu weddings, bright burning bonfires, shared meals, new friends.\r\n\r\nAnd as the blackhole draws near, among ball lightning and under a cracked moon in a kaleidoscope sky, Don and Rodney will look back on their lives and ask if their best was good enough.\r\n\r\nIs it enough to burn bright if nothing comes from the ashes?",

A reluctant adventurer sets off on an unexpected journey in this broadly appealing fantasy at once earnest and self-aware, funny and heartfelt, and thoroughly charming.**\r\n\r\nNell O’Dell yearns for a quiet life tending her garden and caring for her chickens. Unfortunately, her family runs the bustling Crossroads Inn—accommodating all species of patron from fairies to fauns to half-giants, most of them questers on their way to seek glory and fortune. What’s more, her parents are retired questers themselves, and everyone assumes that Nell will follow in their footsteps. Then the day comes when a letter arrives from the government, threatening the Inn and all that Nell holds dear, and someone needs to go on a short journey to the capital to take care of it. Nell is the only one available—but that's fine, because it's just a boring business trip, not a quest! Even if she does find herself up against an excitable travel partner, a thief in the night, a stolen treasure, and a mysterious knife . . . Lively black-and-white illustrations by the author embellish this breezy, bighearted adventure that will satisfy both longtime questers and first-time visitors to the genre.",

He carries packages he doesn’t open, follows routes he doesn’t question, and renews his identity in shrinking access windows. His existence is a suffix on a form. When the suffix expires, so does he.\r\n\r\nLiam Kestrel is a Security & Containment Commander inside Exalta’s administrative core. He enforces compliance, signs disposal orders, and tells himself the system works because it has to. Then a routine surveillance report crosses his desk: an unidentified subject, still breathing, who should have been processed weeks ago. Liam should file the report. He should let the system close the case.\r\nHe doesn’t.\r\n\r\nAs the Runner’s windows slam shut and Liam’s quiet mutiny draws the attention of the people who erase problems rather than solve them, their paths converge on a room where the corporation will demonstrate exactly how it maintains order. There are no firing squads. No gulags. Just paperwork, and the clean silence after it’s filed.\r\n\r\n*For readers of Never Let Me Go and Kafka. A dystopian nightmare where the most terrifying sentence is: “Your request has been processed.”*",

Or, is he?\r\n\r\nWhen a side gig offers Lily access to Hollywood's power players, she weaves a web of traps and landmines, creating cracks in the foundation of Hugh's life and the company he's spent decades building. But as her methods grow riskier, her plan begins to unravel. With her career and future on the line, Lily must confront how far she's willing to go for justice, and whether she's willing to risk every relationship in her life.\r\n\r\nUnraveling alternates between Lily's present-day schemes and the pivotal summer on Nantucket when, as a lonely teen named Morgan, she was first captivated by both Hugh and his charming wife, Elena-- a relationship that left scars she can no longer ignore.",

      "synopsis": "Basil Khan loves mysteries—especially the kind that hide in plain sight. He just never expected to be living inside one.\r\n\r\nWhen a beloved master clockmaker dies and leaves behind a will that doesn’t feel right, sixteen-year-old Basil senses something is wrong. The entire estate is handed to a powerful family, while the people who truly cared for the old man are left with nothing. Everyone else accepts it. Basil doesn’t.\r\n\r\nGuided by curiosity, logic, and a sharp technical mind, Basil begins searching for clues no one else notices. What starts as a quiet investigation soon becomes a race against time—filled with hidden patterns, mechanical puzzles, unexpected dangers, and truths buried beneath silence.\r\n\r\nAs Basil digs deeper, he discovers that the key to the mystery may be connected to an extraordinary object: an old clock designed to hold more than just time.

      "synopsis": "Amidst the devastation of Ireland’s Great Famine, a young woman is salvaged from certain death when offered a mysterious position at a remote manor house haunted by a strange power and the horror of her own memories in this chillingly evocative historical novel braided with gothic horror and supernatural suspense for readers of Katherine Arden’s The Warm Hands of Ghosts and The Silence Factory by Bridget Collins.\r\n\r\nCounty Clare, 1848: In the scant few years since the potato blight first cast its foul shadow over Ireland, Maggie O’Shaughnessy has lost everything—her entire family and the man she trusted with her heart. Toiling in the Ennis Workhouse for paltry rations, she can see no future either within or outside its walls—until the mysterious Lady Catherine arrives to whisk her away to an old mansion in the stark limestone landscape of the Burren.\r\n\r\nLady Catherine wants Maggie to impersonate her late daughter, Wilhelmina, and hoodwink solicitors into releasing Wilhelmina’s widow pension so that Lady Catherine can continue to provide for the villagers in her care. In exchange, Maggie will receive freedom from the workhouse, land of her own, and the one thing she wants more than a chance to fulfill the promise she made to her brother on his deathbed—to live to spite them all.\r\n\r\nLaunching herself into the daunting task, Maggie plays the role of Wilhelmina as best she can while ignoring the villagers’ tales of ghostly figures and curses. But more worrying are the whispers that come from within. Something in Lady Catherine’s house is reawakening long-buried memories in Maggie—of a foe more terrifying than hunger or greed, of a power that calls for blood and vengeance, and of her own role in a nightmare that demands the darkest sacrifice . . .",

Only now, she and Dan Landvik, a detective just promoted to homicide, are trapped on all sides amoral megacorps, an uncaring government, and a mass-murderer that the Minneapolis Police Department doesn’t dare to touch.\r\n\r\nBetrayed by the people they thought they could rely on, facing an enemy they can’t pin down, and without even the name of a victim to go on, Dan and Satya will have to do more than uncover a conspiracy—they’ll have to face their own lifetimes of queer trauma, make allies out of enemies, and maybe even change the world along the way.",

Twelve months.\r\n\r\nHarry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy load, and he needs time.\r\n\r\nBut time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to seal the deal.\r\n\r\nIt's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?",

At first, this seems to work for Ronald, and he spends his days contending with bullies, navigating relationships and even managing to attract the attention of his crush.\r\n\r\nHowever, when his father destroys his computer in a drunken fit of rage, this all changes. Ronald’s main source of comfort and distraction is ripped away from him, and his mental health begins to unravel. Then, an assassin, sent by the Order, arrives at his house.\r\n\r\nRonald cannot outrun his past, and he’s forced to confront a world he’s spent the last year trying to forget. All he can do is try to finish what he and Jiro started. Can he bring vengeance to the woman who killed his brother and restore honor to the family name? Or will Ronald be destroyed by the world that’s already stolen everything from him?",

Kuvassa on mies, joka muistuttaa hänen isäänsä – miestä, joka katosi purjelennolla yli kymmenen vuotta aiemmin. Arki on pysähtynyt\r\nvälitilaan, ja menneisyys pitää yhä otteessaan. Saara päättää lähteä pohjoiseen etsimään totuutta, jota\r\nei ehkä haluaisi kohdata. Matka vie halki Pohjois-Ruotsin ja Norjan jylhien maisemien, mutta samalla\r\nsyvälle omaan sisimpään.\r\n\r\nPohjoisen tie on tarina salaisuuksista, menetyksestä ja halusta ymmärtää. Se yhdistää kadonneen etsinnän ja kasvutarinan elementtejä, kuljettaa isän ja tyttären rinnakkaisia kohtaloita ja etenee kohti paljastusta, joka muuttaa kaiken. Tiivistyvä jännite ja pohjoisen karu miljöö kantavat kertomusta, jossa\r\ntärkeintä ei ole totuuden löytyminen, vaan se, mitä etsintä paljastaa ihmisestä.\r\n\r\nTeos puhuttelee lukijoita, jotka arvostavat emotionaalisesti vahvoja, elämänmakuisia tarinoita ja pohjoisia maisemia.",

She’s rotting in the apartment she shares with her childhood friend Daniel, the insufferable twink Jeff, and Kyle with his helicopter mother and arranged marriage—and there’s no way out.\r\n\r\nUntil Daniel knocks on her door with news of an underground online contest. It awards hormones and surgeries to anyone willing to grow the biggest breasts—so long as they claim they’re cis men, and no fellow competitor can prove otherwise. The prize for these men? A million dollars. For Nicky? Her salvation.\r\n\r\nExcept not all’s as it seems. Daniel is actually Katherine, a trans woman terrified to come out—what if she loses her oldest and only friend? Jeff, hopelessly enamoured with Kyle, turned to the contest to make himself more attractive. And for Kyle, only a million-dollar victory could unshackle him from the life of an eldest desi son.\r\n\r\nAs their lies and desires set the roommates on a collision course, the question remains: what kind of man would compete to take oestrogen? Answer carefully. Online, someone is always watching. Sisters of Dorley meets Stag Dance in this absurdist, satirical drama exploring transfeminine love, community, and identity in times of panic, scarcity, and crackdown.",

      "synopsis": "A grudge hates to see Olivia Hinckley coming. Years ago, a dirty hit ended her late father’s NHL career with the Minnesota Freeze. It was never fair that Erik Parker walked away with little more than a penalty, but it’s worse that her father's rival is now up for Hall of Fame induction. On top of that, Erik's son—hockey’s golden boy, Brody—just signed on to play for the Freeze. Determined to dismantle the Parker legacy, Olivia enacts a revenge plot that has her donning the Freeze’s mascot costume to gain intel on the Parkers. And she can’t help but mess with Brody’s gameplay—and his heart for good measure. After all, what’s a little fake dating between enemies?\r\n\r\nBrody Parker only ever wanted to play hockey for fun, but the pressure of being part of hockey’s “First Family” has him dodging nepotism allegations along with high sticks. Erik might act like Father of the Year when the cameras are on, but behind closed doors, Brody struggles with his father’s impossible expectations. Preserving Erik’s image is a full-time job, but lucky for Brody, his new connection with Olivia is a welcome (spicy) distraction.\r\n\r\nWhen Brody finally opens up to Olivia, she never expected she’d pity a Parker for anything. Suddenly, she wants to protect her once-enemy. The romantic feelings she faked are now unexpectedly real, but after leading Brody on for so long, can she keep the lies and the truth straight before she accidentally blows up his whole life?",

As the proudly type-A manager of a much-needed cat rescue charity, she has devoted her life to finding forever homes for lost cats.\r\n\r\nBut after she is forced to move the cat shelter, Agnes learns that her new landlord is using her charity as a front—for an internationally renowned and thoroughly disreputable magic shop. Owned by the disorganized—not to mention self-absorbed, irritating, but also decidedly handsome—Havelock Renard, magician and failed Dark Lord, the shop draws magical clientele from around the world, partly due to the quality of Havelock’s illicit goods as well as their curiosity about his shadowy past and rumors of his incredible powers. Agnes's charity offers the perfect cover for illegal magics.\r\n\r\nAgnes couldn’t care less about the shop—magical intrigue or not, there are cats to be rescued. But when an enemy from Havelock’s past surfaces, the magic shop—and more importantly, the cat shelter—are suddenly in jeopardy. To save the shelter, will Agnes have to set aside her social conscience and protect the man who once tried to bring about the apocalypse—and is now trying to steal her heart?",

      "synopsis": "Intoxicating substances can be found lurking in every corner of modern life, and Matthew Perkins-McVey’s pathbreaking book offers the untold story of how they were implicated in shifting perceptions of embodiment found in the emerging sciences of the body and mind in late-nineteenth-century Germany. Their use in this experimental context gave rise to a dynamic conception of the subject within the scientific, psychological, philosophical, and sociological milieu of the era. The history of the modern biological subject, Perkins-McVey argues, turns on “intoxicated ways of knowing.”\r\n \r\nIntoxicated Ways of Knowing identifies the state of intoxication as a tacit form of thinking and knowing with the body. Intoxicants force us to feel, intervening directly in our perceptional awareness, and, Perkins-McVey contends, they bring latent conceptual associations into the foreground of conscious thought, engendering new ways of knowing the world. The book unfurls how intoxicants affected nineteenth-century German science and how, ultimately, the connection between mental life and intoxication is taken up in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, and Sigmund Freud, bringing the biological subject out of the lab and into the worlds of philosophy, psychoanalysis, sociology, and politics.",

      "synopsis": "Of Bloodlines and Blue Notes is a hybrid work of music writing and cultural criticism that brings together lyrics, album notes, and critical essays rooted in Black American music as lived practice. Written in conversation with three connected albums, it treats songs as evidence of inheritance shaped by history, labor, survival, and family memory. Blade writes from inside the tradition, reflecting on lineage, the ethics of listening, and what it means to carry the blues forward in the present.",

      "release_date": "2026-03-01",
      "synopsis": "A searing, provocative investigation into the rise of white nationalist and neo-Nazi movements in the United States, centered on the anti-fascist groups working to expose and stop these hateful factions.\r\n\r\nDemonized as “extremist” by conservatives and liberals alike, “antifa” became a bogeyman during Donald Trump’s first term. But few Americans understood the dangerous work antifa was doing to disrupt and unmask a new generation of white supremacists or listened when antifa sounded the alarm about these white supremacists taking positions of power. Now this underground network of militant anti-fascists is determined to stop the rising tide of fascism in America. No matter the cost.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of in-the-room investigative classics such as The Smartest Guys in the Room and Bad Blood, To Catch a Fascist follows different factions of antifascists as they work to unmask hateful extremists before they commit devastating acts of violence. With searing detail and exclusive reporting, To Catch a Fascist paints a vivid picture of the stakes in this ongoing, often unseen war between opposite ends of the political spectrum, highlighting the scrappy resourcefulness and resilience of anti-fascist movements against their increasingly violent adversaries. Utilizing razor-sharp storytelling and eye-opening insight, this timely and necessary book reveals the human cost, moral dilemmas, and unwavering determination involved in fighting white supremacy.\r\n\r\nBoth a call to action and a pulse-raising look at the powerful work being done to combat today’s gravest threat to democracy, To Catch a Fascist will inspire you to fight for your community.",

      "release_date": "2026-03-01",
      "synopsis": "Resumo\r\nEste artigo propõe uma reflexão crítica sobre a famosa metáfora do “cisne negro” de Karl Popper, amplamente utilizada para ilustrar o princípio da falsificabilidade científica. A partir de uma análise biológica e taxonômica, o texto argumenta que a metáfora se apoia em uma indução disfarçada e em uma definição imprecisa do termo “cisne”. O cisne-negro (Cygnus atratus) e o cisne-branco (Cygnus olor) pertencem a espécies distintas, o que compromete a validade da refutação proposta por Popper. A crítica se estende a outros exemplos zoológicos — como garças, papagaios, maritacas, araras, gatos e cães — para mostrar como nomes populares podem agrupar espécies diferentes sob uma mesma designação, gerando confusões conceituais. O artigo conclui que a força de uma refutação científica depende da clareza dos termos utilizados, e que metáforas mal formuladas podem fragilizar o método científico ao confundir ajustes de linguagem com descobertas empíricas.\r\n\r\nPalavras chaves: Filosofia da ciência, Falsificabilidade, Indução, Metáforas científicas, Taxonomia, Cisne negro, Karl Popper, Linguagem científica, Espécies biológicas, Precisão conceitual.\r\n\r\nAbstract (em inglês)\r\nThis article presents a critical reflection on Karl Popper’s famous “black swan” metaphor, widely used to illustrate the principle of scientific falsifiability. Through a biological and taxonomic analysis, it argues that the metaphor relies on disguised induction and an imprecise definition of the term “swan.” The black swan (Cygnus atratus) and the white swan (Cygnus olor) belong to distinct species, which undermines the validity of Popper’s proposed refutation. The critique extends to other zoological examples — such as herons, parrots, parakeets, macaws, cats, and dogs — to demonstrate how popular names often group different species under a single label, leading to conceptual confusion. The article concludes that the strength of scientific refutation depends on the precision of the terms used, and that poorly formulated metaphors can weaken scientific reasoning by conflating linguistic adjustments with empirical discoveries.\r\nKeywords: Philosophy of science, Falsifiability, Induction, Scientific metaphors, Taxonomy, Black swan, Karl Popper, Scientific language, Biological species, Conceptual precision.",

It invites readers to see the world through the eyes of characters who search for meaning, truth, and kindness in the face of hardship. \r\n\r\nThe story unfolds with calm intensity, showing how people live, love, and survive in moments of struggle and silence. Each scene feels natural and alive, written with care and purpose, reflecting the light and shadows of human nature. The author captures both the cruelty of power and the quiet strength of hope, allowing the reader to see how art can express what words often cannot. Shah Jahan is more than a modern drama book; it is an honest portrayal of what it means to be human, to feel pain, and still choose compassion. \r\n\r\nThe writing is simple yet powerful, offering reflections that stay long after the book is closed. Readers who enjoy drama novels books and contemporary fiction books will find in it a voice that speaks to shared experiences and emotions. It is a story that values truth over show, meaning over noise, and hope over despair. Shah Jahan stands as a reminder that even in the hardest times, art can heal, stories can connect us, and humanity continues to seek understanding.",

Despite starting at the very front of the pack, MFG rookie Kanata Katagiri has difficulty getting the most out of his Toyota 86 GT due to an injury unknown to his competitors. Falling further behind, Kanata finds himself in a desperate situation that only stirs up unwanted memories.\n\nAt the head of the race, a vicious battle takes place between the two top drivers in the competition—Michael Beckenbauer and Kouki Sawatari—for the first spot on the podium. Given their aggressive and absurd driving, anyone daring to surpass either of them will have to match their level of pride until the very end. But when all hope seems lost for Kanata, a legendary competitive spirit awakens within him, and it may just push him to overcome his physical limitations and climb back to the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Among the four other crew members is a Gnosia: a Gnos infectee whose goal is the eradication of humanity. The Gnosia appears human in all other respects, so the uninfected have little choice but to vote on whom they suspect to be the enemy, hoping to neutralize the Gnosia by putting them into cold sleep. If the Gnosia survives the vote, they will eliminate one crew member during the cruiser's following warp, when only the Gnosia remains conscious.\n\nVoting quickly proves to be an unreliable strategy, and Yuuri is left one-on-one with the Gnosia. Just when all hope seems lost, time seemingly loops back to when Yuuri first awakened. With each time loop, however, conditions aboard the ship change—neither the size of the crew nor the members' identities remain constant. Trapped in both time and space, Yuuri must figure out how to escape the loops and save humanity from the Gnosia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, one day, the party leader abruptly dismisses him, claiming his skills are lacking. Branded a \"weakling\" and a \"jack of all trades, master of none,\" by his former comrades, Orn is cast out without a second thought.\n\nDetermined to start anew, he returns to adventuring—this time as a Swordsman, the role he originally excelled in. But his time as an Enchanter was far from wasted. The experience, knowledge, and countless original spells he developed in the Hero Party have forged him into a warrior unlike any other. Now, armed with an unconventional set of skills, Orn is ready to carve his own path—one that will prove his true strength to the world.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Their interactions are brief, limited to Suzuki's unprompted random questions and Tani's succinct answers. Yet, beneath these simple exchanges, feelings of love are quietly blossoming.\n\nSuzuki sees Tani for who he is: a straightforward boy who respects everyone equally, completely unconcerned about fitting in. Unlike Tani, she is too hung up on what everyone else thinks, desperate to keep her crush a secret. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to Suzuki confessing her feelings—and to her delight, Tani feels the same. Jittery with excitement, the young couple starts dating, embarking on a wonderful journey of friendship and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
